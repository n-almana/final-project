      I was going there for its academic excellence </br>
      or its abundance of opportunities, </br>
      the land of the free </br>
      where people from all over the world convene </br>
      in pursuit of the American Dream. </br>                         
      Some of them working &#8208 </br>
      sometimes forever &#8208 while their families waiting </br>
      to no avail. To die trying. </br>
      A girl could lose all hope in that place. </br>
      </br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was going there </br>                        
      to attain some space from </br>
      all that brings both pain and joy, </br>
      always together. Simultaneously </br>
      holding me back and pushing me forward. </br>
      Others in my position &#8208 never </br>                         
      making it back &#8208 leaving their families. </br>
      In pursuit of what is supposed to matter: studies, </br>
      degrees, employment. Disguised flight in education.  </br>
      </br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I went there </br>
      a student, still studying for exams  </br>                    
      trying to pass my courses, though really </br>
      learning the basics of life. (How else </br>
      am I supposed to grow?) My classmates </br>
      reading their books &#8208 as their parents </br>
      told them to &#8208 showing me what </br>                      
      must be done to obtain that which we all seek. </br>
      </br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stayed </br>
      four years though I never imagined </br>
      my completion. In my early days, </br>
      I never would have seen myself independent </br>                    
      across the ocean in pursuit of knowledge &#8208 </br>
      or was it peace? &#8208 despite the distance </br>
      and my lost tongue </br>
      that still allowed the abroad </br>
      (student that I am) to feel at home. </br>
