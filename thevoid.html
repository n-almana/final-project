    <h1>The Void</h1>
    <div id="poem"> 
    Day after day the same things happen, the same faces pass by and the same people become one. </br> 
    Culture clones all wearing the coolest clothes blending in with the status quo. </br> 
    The monotonous routine pulls me into this black hole, </br> 
    Trying to confine me into this role </br> 
    Got me thinking I'm not even sure I'm who I want to be </br> 
    Even though I claimed I'm just doing me. </br> 
    </br> 
    Drifting in and out of life, blending in with the background that is my reality, </br> 
    with nothing new to excite or inspire me. </br> 
    I'm meandering through life with complete dissatisfaction </br> 
    Numb to all emotions, just waiting for some motivation. </br> 
    I'm drowning in an abyss of pure emptiness </br> 
    with no sense of purpose but no one seems to take notice. </br> 
    </br> 
    I'm always surrounded by people but it's crazy how alone I always feel. </br> 
    White noise and fillers is what they seem to be </br> 
    Taking up space but with no real use to me </br> 
    So I lock my door, ignore the world, and forget that I'm here, </br> 
    Forget that I'm alone and forget my fears. </br> 
    I get lost in my thoughts and let my stream of consciousness fill up the void and bring me back to life, bring me back to the reason why I'm here </br> 
    because as much as it sucks to be here, it will suck just as bad to be over there. </br> 
    </br>  
    I made this decision with my best interest in mind </br> 
    I had to be selfish at least one time </br> 
    Conflicted with equally powerful desires like Jekyll and Hyde. </br> 
    Isn't it human nature to try to survive? </br> 
    So I put my own needs first, flipped my life around and started anew. </br> 
    Knocked aside my fears and didn't do what I was supposed to do. </br> 
    I escaped myself and started living my life in a different discourse </br> 
    But I still haven't managed to figure out which one is worse. </br> 
    </br> 
    They say living in another country changes you </br> 
    But was it worth it because now I'm lost and need to review </br> 
    I am two distinct people who cannot get along </br> 
    Distorting my sense of what is right and wrong </br> 
    The story ends with, "I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end." </br> 
    So I sit here and wonder did I really just lead my life to a dead end? </br>
