    <h1>Grown Ups</h1>
    <div id="poem"> 
    I wanted to be a grown up so bad when I was younger that I just couldn't wait. </br> 
    I thought grown ups were kind of like superheroes. </br> 
    They could do everything I couldn't or didn't know how to. </br> 
    </br> 
    I wanted to be a grown up so bad because I didn't want to feel helpless. </br> 
    I didn't want to rely on the grown ups to take care of me. </br> 
    I wanted to know what to do when something was wrong like my parents and teachers did. </br> 
    They always knew what to say, what to do, how to do it. </br> 
    I wanted to be like that too. </br> 
    </br> 
    I couldn't wait to be a grown up until: </br> 
    I got that piece of plastic that tells people I'm the type of grown up that can sign my own contract. </br> 
    I got that piece of plastic that tells people I'm the type of grown up that can drink any type of liquid I want. </br> 
    I got that piece of paper that tells people I'm the type of grown up that is prepared and qualified to take a job and salary in my field. </br> 
    </br> 
    I got all these grown up things that tell me I can finally adult now. </br> 
    Yes, I just used it as a verb because it seems to be the most appropriate and hell - I'm a grown up now, I can do whatever I want. </br> 
    </br> 
    But you see here's what I learned from all these grown up achievements: </br> 
    </br> 
    I learned that grown ups are not superheroes, they're just good at pretending to be. And I, well I became dangerously good at pretending too. </br> 
    Hiding my confusion. </br> 
    Hiding my depression. </br> 
    Hiding the helplessness that I still felt. </br> 
    </br> 
    I learned that grown ups are oxymorons - </br> 
    contradictions of how they are perceived versus how they really are and feel inside. </br> 
    </br> 
    I became a grown up that would take oxy to hide the fact that I felt like a moron for actually believing that growing up would make everything better. </br> 
    </br> 
    So I guess I finally am a grown up now because apparently that's just what grown ups do. </br>
