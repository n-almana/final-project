    <h1>Sad Story Dipped In Gold</h1>
    <div id="poem"> 
      This ain't a story about the haves and the have-nots </br> 
      This ain't about the drugs and the gun shots </br> 
      This is how the haves can be have-nots </br> 
      Take a listen before you judge 'em so here we go </br> 
      Just another sad story to be told </br> 
      The money and the mansion ain't strong enough to hold </br> 
      The cracks and the fractures sealed by the mold </br> 
      Everything crashing down left the scars in bold </br> 
      20 years old and I still can't let it go </br> 
      Let me break it down so you can hear another sad story dipped in gold. </br> 
      </br> 
      See my dad was never absent but he was complex </br> 
      The type that made me want to leave for good and never do look back </br> 
      The type that makes the struggle of Jekyll versus Hyde look wack </br> 
      The epitome of duality leaving me not knowing which one I'd get </br> 
      Every time I'm walking through the door, it's Jekyll I'm looking for, </br> 
      The one that I adore, but it wouldn't be a sad story dipped in gold </br> 
      If Hyde didn't come pouncing out the door </br> 
      Scarring me for life with his broken words </br> 
      I hate you, I love you, I wish you were dead </br> 
      Followed by I never meant to hurt you, all in the same breath </br> 
      Here we go with the biggest lie ever told </br> 
      Can't you see this is just another sad story dipped in gold? </br>
