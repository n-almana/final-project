      <i> Hi, my name is Noora Al-Mana.</i> </br> 
      I never said this simple sentence just like that before I stepped on to this campus. </br> 
      You are probably thinking that I'm lying because I had to have introduced myself before; </br> 
      but I've actually never said it that way before. </br> 
      My name is نوره بنت محمد بن فهد المانع (Noora bint Mohammed bin Fahad Al-Mana).  </br> 
      If that's too long I just go with نوره المانع (Noora Al-Mana). </br> 
      I never had to worry about it being too difficult to pronounce, </br> 
      too foreign to fit in, </br> 
      too exotic to accept. </br> 
      Except when I got here. </br> 
      </br> 
      A slightly nuanced way of pronouncing my name suddenly slipped </br> 
      out of my tongue in my first introduction in August of 2011. </br> 
      <i> Hi, my name is Noora Al-Mana. </i> </br> 
      I didn't think too much of it. That's still my name. </br> 
      I'm just making it a little bit easier. </br> 
      A little bit easier. (Easier for who? For me or for you?) </br> 
      Why was it easy for me to drop an O in saying my name? </br> 
      So easy that I started doing it without realizing it? </br> 
      </br> 
      Maybe it's because it sounds so... Arabic </br> 
      So... Middle Eastern  </br> 
      So... different </br> 
      Yet dropping one letter can change that. </br> 
      Or maybe it's because it reminds me of home and everything I left behind. </br> 
      Or maybe it has nothing to do with that at all... </br> 
      </br> 
      I quickly realized that this slight change was not my attempt to assimilate to the culture here. </br> 
      That was never my intention or desire. </br> 
      No. This was my desperate attempt to escape my past. </br> 
      Something as core and integral as my name reminded me of who I was before coming here: </br> 
      A girl that always did what she was told. </br> 
      Obeyed all orders. </br> 
      Never questioned anything. </br> 
      Never spoke up when she disagreed. </br> 
      A girl that was always afraid. </br> 
      </br> 
      I hated that. </br> 
      Something as trivial as pronouncing my name how I have always said it, </br> 
      How everyone else have always said it, </br> 
      How it should be said &#8208 </br> 
      Reminded me of her. </br> 
      </br> 
      I abandoned that girl 3 and a half years ago. </br> 
      I left her in Qatar and went half way across the world. </br> 
      I stopped saying her name. </br> 
      I stopped introducing her to people. </br> 
      I was too ashamed. </br> 
      </br> 
      At least that's what I thought I did... </br> 
      </br> 
      The truth is that girl is still here. </br> 
      She always has been. </br> 
      That girl grew to become someone even I didn't recognize. </br> 
      I'm glad she didn't leave. </br> 
      She is still here. </br> 
      I am still here.  </br>     
      <i> So hi, my name is Noora. </i> </br>
