    <h1>The Director's Stage</h1>
    <div id="poem"> 
        Acting </br> 
        beyond myself and this facade. </br> 
        Carrying my own weight </br> 
        <i>Don't look back now!</i> </br> 
        Even when times get rough  </br> 
        for now and forever </br> 
        greater times ahead, </br> 
        harder times ahead. </br> 
        I know I have to play this role </br> 
        just to survive, by </br>        
        killing time or setting the scene, </br> 
        living life and </br> 
        making the most of whatever I have. </br> 
        Never regretting </br> 
        or wishing otherwise.  </br>  
        Pulling myself away from the director's space, </br> 
        Qatar, the stage where my heart used to be </br> 
        running away from the memories yet </br> 
        smiling still because of them. </br> 
        The same ones buried </br>  
        under the trap door of shame, </br> 
        virtues and encumbrances, one and the same </br> 
        when it comes to my past plays. Like an algebraic variable: </br> 
        X, whatever I want it to be, ever changing </br> 
        yet always yearning for the lead role. I will not allow it. Undoubtedly  </br>  
        zealous with my intent. No applause necessary. No standing ovation. </br>
