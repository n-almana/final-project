    <div id="poem"> 
      Love is a ninja. </br> 
      Quiet and quick. </br> 
      No one sees it coming, </br>  
      you just feel its nunchuks </br> 
      leaving you disoriented.  </br>                         
      Its stealth will turn your life upside down </br> 
      and leave you struggling to get back up. </br> 
      It doesn't come with a caution sign or a warning; </br> 
      it silently crashes into every bit of your soul </br> 
      and shatters you into a million little pieces </br> 
      when it decides to leave. </br> 
      Yes. I did say <i>when</i>. </br> 
      </br> 
      Love shows up uninvited. </br> 
      Love does not give a fuck. </br> 
      It is rude and disruptive. </br> 
      Love never follows social rules </br> 
      And never does what you want it to. </br> 
      It is never expected nor welcomed. </br> 
      Love will cut you deeper than any shuriken. </br> 
      Love will scar you in the most beautiful ways. </br>     
      Love is worth it. </br> 
      </br> 
      - I hope. </br>
